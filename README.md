Cortex
======

##Idea##
This is aimed to be an [presence server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_service) for adhoc chat applications. It will be deployed on a rasberry Pi, allowing any client existing in proximity to the server to join a chat session with other nearby clients and get the history of all messages while absent.


##Development##
###Requirements###
You need to have [node](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs), [mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) and redis installed.

###Installing###
	   $ git clone git://git@github.com:anas-ambri/Cortex.git
	   $ cd Cortex
	   $ npm install
	   $ npm start

###Running the tests###
